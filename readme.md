# DeMoment
[DeMoment](https://demoment.deta.dev) is a decentralized social network for sharing and discussing moments.

Most people know someone who has heard of the incredible salary associated with working in technology, only to crumble under the tough expectations and long hours. These people became the inspiration for this project: combatting existing assumptions through a unique style of social media including randomized times to request everyone's posts and statuses. Our exclusive twist is to make our social media decentralized, powered by DeSo, so users can have control over their data without the fear of centralized governance removing any content. Whether DeMoment is about developing an application in Python or baking a cheesecake, users can join a chain (community) where they can ask questions to gain an understanding of the genuine experience. DeMoment strives to demonstrate the reality of some of these communities, showing the experience of user communities at different steps of the process.
